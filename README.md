# Earth-Obs
In this repository I gather my projects about processing and analysis of satellite data.

For now, projects focus on the following missions from the Copernicus Upstream Component:

- **Sentinel-1** is a collection of notebooks featuring the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for applications such as topography, agriculture, and forestry.
- **Sentinel-2** is a collection of notebooks featuring the use of multispectral data for applications such as resource management, urban planning and monitoring, land degradation, deforestation.
- **Sentinel-3** is a collection of notebooks featuring the use of Radimetric and Optical data for applications such as climate monitoring, fire detection, and solar radiation for agriculture.
